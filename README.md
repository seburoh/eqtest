# Archived Project

This is a previously completed academic project which is not currently supported.

# eqTest
This project was created for use in a Data Structures class where proper JUnit testing suites were not allowed to be used. The goal of this project was to properly and efficiently test code written, without ugly and potentially incomplete main method testing. It supports basic functionality for checking if two objects are equal, null, or if a boolean is true/false. This project also includes support for timing functions, as efficiency of code written in Data Structures is important to understand and track.

# To Use
The most direct and simple way to use this code is to create a java file in *package test* and call upon the contained functions. Each function emulates the syntax of JUnit 5, including a failure print message as the last argument.
